    "The code below reproduces Figure 1 a (the Poverty Space of Turkmenistan in 2006 and 2019). In these networks, nodes are poverty indicators, and edges between them indicate significant connections. The node size corresponds to its poverty centrality, while its color matches the censored headcount ratio of the indicator.\n",

    "We see that for Turkmenistan, Housing was the most central poverty indicator in 2006 (located in the core), while Electricity was the least central (located in the periphery). This suggests a household in 2006 Turkmenistan, if deprived in any other indicator, was most likely to also lack adequate Housing. Conversely, if a household was deprived in any indicator, it was the least probable to also be deprived in Electricity. Various factors such as geographic location, access to quality services, systemic inequality, and socio-economic policies could contribute to this specific poverty structure. The Poverty Space compiles these factors into a network visualization, revealing the underlying relationships between poverty indicators. By 2019, Child Mortality became the most central indicator in Turkmenistan, signifying dynamic relationships among poverty indicators that adapt in response to socio-economic changes and potential policy interventions."

We find a correlation between poverty centrality and the headcount ratio . Though, this correlation is only moderate, suggesting that the poverty space and the headcount ratio do not offer the same information about the structure of multidimensional poverty.\n",

    "In Figure 2 b, we determined the median centrality for each indicator across all countries, using only data from the final survey year. This measurement provides a snapshot of an indicator's \"typical\" importance across countries, offering a benchmark to assess the uniqueness of a country's poverty structure. On average, Cooking Fuel emerges as the most central indicator (located in the core), with Child Mortality being the least central (located in the periphery). \n",

    "## FIGURE 2 C\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated the sensitivity of the Poverty Space in each country to missing poverty indicators by removing one poverty indicator at a time, recalculating the structural dependence matrix, and comparing the Poverty Centrality of the rest of the indicators in the recalculated matrix to their original values. Figure 2 c displays boxplots representing the distribution of the correlation between the poverty centrality measures when one indicator is removed. Our analysis reveals that this correlation is almost always above 0.9. This lack of significant differences suggests the robustness of the Poverty Space.\n",

    "### Model initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "PPI offers two distinct methods for analyzing multidimensional poverty. First, the “retrospective” analysis seeks to understand past dynamics by leveraging historical data from an initial survey year, revealing how poverty indicators and policy priorities (budget allocations for an indicator) have evolved over a certain observation period to reach observed values in a final year. This analysis can infer an optimal spillover rate (the spillover rate that best fits the data) and other model parameters (e.g., α_ci and α_ci^'). Understanding these parameters is essential as spillover rates can vary widely or modestly between dimensions and countries, influencing policy intervention outcomes. Second, the “prospective” analysis uses historical insights to understand how changes in the spillover rate or the Poverty Space could affect multidimensional poverty dynamics over a future period. This approach guides policymakers on which poverty indicators to prioritize and when, helping to inform effective intervention strategies for future improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the retrospective analysis, we use national data on poverty indicators from the first survey year (2011) and the last survey year (2019), government expenditure data (per capita in constant USD) from 2011 to 2019, data on the quality of law and monitoring from the World Bank’s World Governance Indicators for 2011 (the quality of law is approximated with the rule of law variable, whereas the quality of monitoring with the control of corruption), and the estimated Poverty Space for 2011. We estimate the model parameters and find the optimal spillover rate by calibrating the model with spillover rates ranging from 0 to 1 (in increments of 0.05) and calculating the goodness of fit. The rate providing the best fit on average is our optimal spillover rate. See Appendix 4 for more details on the data cleaning and calibration procedures for our PPI analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then conduct a prospective analysis until 2030 using data from the final survey year (2019) and Poverty Space data for the same year. We assume that the rule of law and quality of monitoring remain at the 2019 level and that government expenditure remains at its average value from 2011 to 2019. In this analysis, we again vary the spillover rate from 0 to 1 to perturb the Poverty Space structure and assess how poverty interlinkages could impact multidimensional poverty dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings: \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3 details the impact of the Poverty Space on the inferred PPI simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in Figure 3a we visualize how varying the spillover rate impacts PPI’s estimated MPI for Ethiopia in 2030 (black line). The blue horizontal dashed line represents Ethiopia’s MPI in 2019 (0.567, the beginning of the prospective simulation), while the red vertical line marks the optimal spillover rate identified in the retrospective analysis. Our analysis finds this value to be 0.7, indicating that spillovers could heavily influence Ethiopia’s multidimensional poverty dynamics. If the spillover rate remains at this level, we project Ethiopia’s MPI to decrease by 0.103 units by 2030 (to 0.464). Conversely, if the spillover rate drops to 0, the MPI would fall by only 0.036 units (to 0.531). An increase in the spillover rate to 1 (implying that the spillover network matches the Poverty Space) would result in a 0.109 unit decline in MPI (to 0.458). Interestingly, our results suggest that Ethiopia’s multidimensional poverty dynamics are more responsive to a reduction in the poverty rates when the MPI increases compared to an increase in the spillover rate above the inferred optimal value. These findings suggest that bottlenecks in spillovers between indicators could substantially affect poverty reduction in Ethiopia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, in Figure 3 b, we show the average spillovers (between 2021 and 2030) received by each poverty indicator during the prospective analysis for various values of  r^c as a function of Poverty Centrality. We observe a nearly perfect correlation between these two variables for each choice of  r^c. This indicates that Poverty Centrality effectively reflects the spillovers in PPI simulations. Importantly, it suggests that while Poverty Centrality can identify which indicators are most likely to receive spillovers, the actual volume of spillovers is dependent on the rate   r^c . Thus, Poverty Centrality serves as a relative metric, providing insights into the potential distribution of spillovers among indicators, but the magnitude of these spillovers varies with the spillover rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to Figure 3 c, we illustrate the censored headcount ratio of each indicator as a function of the spillover rate. This analysis allows us to see how each poverty indicator’s censored headcount ratio changes as the spillover rate varies. Indicators with the lowest and highest values for the censored headcount ratio show the least susceptibility to changes in the spillover rate, indicating that their the censored headcount ratio remains relatively stable even as  r^c varies. In contrast, indicators with intermediate levels of the censored headcount ratio appear the most susceptible, showing greater fluctuations with changes in  r^c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3 d provides a more detailed view by plotting the changes in the censored headcount ratio for each indicator as a function of their 2019 levels under different spillover rates. Indeed, two indicators with intermediate levels of CHR in 2019 (Schooling and Drinking Water) display the largest change due to changes in the spillover rate. This result suggests that the responsiveness of indicators with intermediate censored headcount ratio levels to changes in spillover rates might be due to shifts in policy priority driven by spillover effects, at least in Ethiopia. When spillovers are present, resources and attention may be redistributed towards these intermediate indicators, thereby amplifying their susceptibility to changes in the spillover rate. This underscores the importance of considering how policy priorities and resource allocations may shift due to spillover effects. By identifying which indicators are most responsive to these shifts, policymakers can better target their efforts to maximize the impact of resource allocation and intervention strategies, ensuring that critical areas receive the necessary support to reduce poverty effectively.\n",
